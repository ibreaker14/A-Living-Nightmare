The basic premise of the story is that the player is dreaming, but he/she does not know this. The player is a student who wakes up in a familiar surrounding (in this case, the Linux Room in 4th floor of the CSULB ECS Building). However, as the player navigates through map, he/she discovers that the area isn't so familiar after all. The staircase is gone and there are only 8 rooms (including the elevator) that is connected by a central corridor. The current floor the player is on seems to look like the fourth floor, but it is actually on a floor that is much higher with an elevation of more than 200 feet. The trick to winning beating the game is for the player to commit suicide in order to jolt himself/herself awake. There are essentially two ways to win the game.

## Route 1 of 2

After the player wakes up, he/she is shrouded in darkness. All the lights in the building do not seem to work and nor does running water. However, a single computer in the Linux room seems to be powered up and ready to be used. At first glance, the computer seems to be just an ordinary computer, but once a certain hack drive is inserted into the computer the player will be able to hack it to uncover a hidden message. 

The only source of light at the moment is the faint light of the computer screen as well as a digital alarm clock that is next to it. As this is a dream, time does not pass normally. The time is stuck at 2:15AM and the only way the player can know the time is by examining the clock closely. Hidden inside the clock are some batteries conveniently placed within. When the clock is opened and batteries are taken from the clock, the player will not be able to tell the time any more. 

If the player ventures into the corridor, which is north of the Linux room, the player will be unable to go anywhere else but back into the Linux room due to lack of visibility. When player enters the corridor, he/she will kick a small object that is on the floor. Upon closer inspection, it seems to be a flashlight. The player needs to pick up the flashlight and switch it on (batteries taken from the clock will automatically be inserted into the flashlight).

To beat the game, the player will need to go into Anthony Giacalone's office. There will be a drawer with items inside as well as a locked safe that requires a password combination. The player will need to take the flashdrive out of the drawer and go back into the Linux room. The player will then insert the flashdrive into the master computer. The computer is now hackable. The player will need to manually "hack computer" (refer to documentation). An equation will be displayed to the user which will need to be solved in order to complete the hack. After computer is hacked, the player will be notified of a hidden message containing the safe combination in Anthony Giacalone's office. After the player unlocks the safe, he/she will need to open it in, which uncovers a crowbar. The player will then take the crowbar and pry the elevator door open with it, which is east of the corridor (the command "unlock elevator with crowbar" will also work). If player goes east again, he/she will be warned that he/she almost fell into the elevator shaft behind the elevator door. Player dies when user confirms intentions to go into the elevator shaft. The player wakes up from the dream, thereby successfully beating the game.

The player needs to pick up the flashlight and switch it on (batteries taken from the clock will automatically be inserted into the flashlight).

North of the corridor is a window. The window can be broken by attacking, kicking, punching, smashing, headbutting, etc. it several times. It can also be smashed or pried open with the crowbar found in Anthony Giacalone's safe (refer to route #1). After the window is broken, the player can then kill himself/herself by falling into the schoolyard below, ending the game. The player will then wake up and realize he/she is dreaming.

## Gameplay
The game is intended to trap the player in a modified version of the CSULB ECS 4th floor. The goal of the game is to make the player wander the halls of the ECS Building forever without realizing he/she needs commit suicide to end the game. Locked doors (windows and elevators) in the game need to be explitly smashed or pried open before user can gain access to the other side. A capacity limit has been put on the player to limit the items he/she can carry. Random objects are strewn across the rooms in hopes of confusing the player. Fake puzzles like a book with a missing page or a message written on a board act to confuse the player further. 

In this game, the player is able to "use" objects in rooms with the keyword "use". Depending on the nature of an action, its meaning changes as well. For instance, using a flashlight switches it on, using a sink allows player to wash his/her hands, and using a safe allows user to enter in a passcode. Player can also interact with objects. For instance, player can play with a frisbee, use a stapler, or mess around with a banana peel. Try it out and see for yourself.
